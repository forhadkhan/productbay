WooCommerce product tables with search, filters, and pagination for high-converting, responsive product listings and easy browsing.

== Description ==

ProductBay is a modern, high-performance plugin designed to revolutionize how WooCommerce products are displayed. It bridges the gap between a robust PHP backend and a dynamic, reactive frontend, providing a seamless experience for both administrators and customers.

Unlike traditional table plugins, ProductBay utilizes a Hybrid Architecture:
*   **Admin Panel:** A fully responsive Single Page Application (SPA) built with React and Tailwind CSS.
*   **Frontend Display:** A lightweight, SEO-friendly rendering engine optimized for Core Web Vitals, enhanced with instant AJAX filtering.

**Key Features**

*   **Hybrid Architecture:** React-powered admin for fluid management, lightweight PHP/JS frontend for speed.
*   **Instant Search & Filtering:** AJAX-driven filtering allows users to find products without page reloads.
*   **Modern Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS for a premium, consistent, and responsive look.
*   **Secure & Scalable:** Implements Nonce verification, sanitized inputs, and a repository pattern for database interactions.
